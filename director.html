            Motivated by a collective aspiration for self-improvement,
            marginalized women in Kymore, Madhya Pradesh, and Bassi, Rajasthan
            articulated a pressing need for English language proficiency.
            Responding to their earnest aspirations, IndiVillage Foundation,
            IndiVillage Tech Solutions, Adani Foundation, and Ekakanya Trust
            united to deliver English language training through weekly sessions
            facilitated by Queen's English.
            <br />
            <br />The hallmark of this year lies in our remarkable expansion of
            impact on the ground. Our impact numbers for 2022-23 was 4309
            participants compared to 23,771 in this year. At the heart of our
            success lies the fundamental shift in mindset- from incremental to
            exponential.
            <br />
            <br />We have not only grown in numbers but also transformed into a
            very effective and efficient organisation. One of the most
            remarkable aspects of this year has been the incredible spirit of
            community engagement and participation that we received at every
            level. Individuals from grassroots communities came together in a
            spirit of collaboration, generously volunteering their time, skills
            and resources to support our cause, and eventually increasing the
            number of volunteers from forty two, to hundred and fifty eight.

            None of this would be possible without support from IndiVillage
            (IV). Not only IV provides us with the financial resources to run
            our programs, but they also provide unwavering support and
            commitment for the upliftment of rural youth in India. They have
            been the cornerstone of our foundation. We would like to give a
            shout out to the Machani group, which incubated IndiVillage and
            provided it with support to soar to new heights.
            <br />

            <br />Despite the challenges and several new undertakings, the
            quality of our programs remains intact, continues to grow, and
            impact even larger number of people.
            <br />
            <br />We have developed our own curriculum for Storytelling
            Saturdays aligned with the current National Education Policy of
            India. Furthermore we emphasised concrete and measurable metrics to
            analyse base line end line data.

            Village (I.V). Not only I.V provides us with the financial resources
