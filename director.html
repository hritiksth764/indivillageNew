            I am deeply honoured to present our annual impact report, reflecting
            on the year 2023 to 2024. This year has been a testament to our
            unwavering commitment, remarkable growth, formidable challenges and
            inspiring achievements, propelling IndiVillage Foundation to new
            heights.
            <br />
            <br />The hallmark of this year lies in our remarkable expansion of
            impact on the ground. Our impact numbers for 2022-23 was 4309
            participants compared to 23,771 in this year. At the heart of our
            success lies the fundamental shift in mindset- from incremental to
            exponential.
            <br />
            <br />We have not only grown in numbers but also transformed into a
            very effective and efficient organisation. One of the most
            remarkable aspects of this year has been the incredible spirit of
            community engagement and participation that we received at every
            level. Individuals from grassroots communities came together in a
            spirit of collaboration, generously volunteering their time, skills
            and resources to support our cause, and eventually increasing the
            number of volunteers from forty two, to hundred and fifty eight.

            We forged alliances with the Karnataka Skill Development corporation
            for skilling initiatives and collaborated with Quest Alliance to
            help design the curriculum for our initiative 'Tech Her Forward' and
            skilling programs. We also partnered with Saturday Art Class to
            enhance the creative and engaging aspects of our Storytelling
            Saturday curriculum.
            <br />

            <br />Despite the challenges and several new undertakings, the
            quality of our programs remains intact, continues to grow, and
            impact even larger number of people.
            <br />
            <br />We have developed our own curriculum for Storytelling
            Saturdays aligned with the current National Education Policy of
            India. Furthermore we emphasised concrete and measurable metrics to
            analyse base line end line data.
            <br />
            <br />None of this would be possible without support from Indi
            Village (I.V). Not only I.V provides us with the financial resources
            to run our programs, but they also provide unwavering support and
            commitment for the upliftment of rural youth in India. They have
            been the cornerstone of our foundation. We would

            like to give a shout out to the Machani group, which incubated
            IndiVillage and provided it with support to soar to new heights.Â 
            <br />
            <br />Thank you being a part of our journey, for your continued
            support, and for sharing our vision of exponential mindset & growth.
            <br />
            <br />As we gaze into the future, we are filled with optimism and
            determination. There is still much work to be done, many challenges
            to overcome and countless lives to touch.
